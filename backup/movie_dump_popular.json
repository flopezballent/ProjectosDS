Fitzroy impressed by Gentry's lethal skills and lack of familial connections offers him recruitment into the Sierra program, wherein convicted felons agree to work for the CIA as deniable off the books assets who can \"operate in the gray\" in exchange for commuted sentences, which Gentry accepts taking the designation Sierra Six (\"Six\" for short). 18 years later Gentry continues to operate for the CIA as the last member of the Sierra program much to the ire of Denny Carmichael (Reg\u00e9-Jean Page) who has succeeded Fitzroy in position and voices disdain for Fitzroy's tenure including the Sierra program. When an assassination in Bangkok assigned to Six reveals his target was Sierra Four, Four gives Six an encrypted drive that was Carmichael's true objective and this sends Six into the wind. Carmichael seeking to retrieve the drive before it can be decrypted enlists the aid of sociopathic private contractor and former CIA assassin Lloyd Hansen (Chris Evans) to take down Six and retrieve the drive and Hansen issues a bounty on Six that sends every assassin after Six. Additionally Hansen takes hostage Six's now retired mentor Fitzroy as well as Fitzroy's niece Claire (Julia Butters) to ensure Six has no allies.The Gray Man is an adaptation of the novel of the same name that is the first in a series by author Mark Greaney who first came to prominence as a co-author on several Tom Clancy novels during Clancy's final years. Published in 2009, attempts had been made as far back as 2011 with Brad Pitt initially slated to play the lead only for the project to never come together, and later Charlize Theron entered discussions to play a genderswapped version of The Gray Man but this too never came to pass and Theron instead pursued her adaptation of The Coldest City with Atomic Blonde. The eventually landed at Netflix in June of 2020 with directors Anthony and Joe Russo who'd directed some of the MCUs best regarded films and a budget of $200 million making it the most expensive project to ever be tackled by Netflix. With a well regarded series of books and an A-List team behind and in front of the camera, it's clear Netflix wants this to be a long lasting franchise and given all those solid parts it probably will be, but while the movie is entertaining it's not going to be the replacement for Bond of Mission: Impossible the producers clearly want (yet anyway).To start off on the best aspects of The Gray Man, the movie delivers everything you hope to see from a big budget directorial effort by the Russo Brothers with the plethora of international locales, epic scope of the action, and thrilling and creative action sequences that wow and dazzle with the technical craft firing on all cylinders. The movie features a great supporting cast with Bond alum Ana de Armas as Dani Miranda a nice Deuteragonist to the movie even if she does feel like she ducks in and out appearing at just the right time after we've lost track of her, Billy Bob Thorton is quite good as Fitzroy and brings his quirky offbeat charisma to the well worn mentor figure as reliable as ever, and Julia Butters is also very good as Fitroy's niece Claire with Fitzroy and Claire nicely positioned for Six as a surrogate family who add emotional weight to the stakes. But hands down the best performance is Chris Evans playing wildly against type as Lloyd Hansen who's about as far from his Captain America persona as you can get without playing Hitler. Hansen is an absolute monster and he clearly loves every minute of it as he revels in sadistic glee at trying to take down Six and alternates his superior smirk with bouts of violent and explosive rage that more often than not have a lethal edge to them as his handler Suzanne played by Jessica Henwick tries in vain to keep tis rabid dog on a leash. The movie's really solid and engaging entertaining with the supporting cast, the action, and the villains elevating the very stock \"stolen list\" plot that's part and parcel to most spy movies, but the movie doesn't do all that much at making the titular Gray Man himself all that interesting with Six feeling more akin to an audience proxy than a fully fleshed character.While Gosling is a good actor and effectively plays \"strong and silent\" type hard edged protagonists as seen in Drive, I never felt like that was a stylistic choice here and more like Gosling's character was just a blank slate. Admittedly they do give Gosling more meat to chew on around the halfway point and even gives him opportunity for some humor, but for a good stretch of the movie Six is very opaque as a character with the nature of who and why he murdered someone not revealed until the beginning of the third act. I think that's what holds this movie back from being on the same level as the best of 007 or Mission: Impossible because it doesn't have a hero as defined as James Bond or Ethan Hunt in their best adventures, I do think however it's better than Quantum of Solace, Spectre, Mission: Impossible II & III, and especially that last Jason Bourne film, but it's still not quite at the level of the best of the comparable spy franchises.The Gray Man is a solid entry in the genre of spy themed action thrillers and will definitely satisfy the appetites of those waiting for Mission: Impossible to close its book and a new face to say \"Bond, James Bond\" as it delivers on action, spectacle, and character to solid measure. The movie doesn't make its titular Gray Man the most interesting protagonist with his monosyllabic title and largely stoic delivery in the first half keeping us from getting to know him all that much character wise, but there is solid ground developed if they do decide to pursue a sequel.", "helpful": 39, "title": "It may not be the \"Bond killer\" I'm sure the producers were hoping for, but The Gray Man is a solid action thriller that delivers.", "author": "ur117926588", "date": "23 July 2022", "rating": 7, "not_helpful": 17}, {"content": "Mediocre.

Gosling is Sierra Six, released from prison eighteen years earlier upon the request of CIA operative Don Fitzroy (Billy Bob Thornton) in exchange for his life as an off the grid, untraceable assassin. With the usual handful of double crosses and expected twists, Six runs an international gamut of hit-teams and mercenaries to continually thwart his primary foe Lloyd Hansen (Chris Evans), who's disregard for the usual norms of covert government agencies earned him the contract to take out Six. But come on, you know that wasn't going to happen right from the start, whether or not you've seen a few dozen of these types of pictures. A back story involving Fitzroy's niece (Julia Butters) is also in play, adding to the unenviable task of Six keeping an encrypted disc out of the hands of his formidable adversary. The finale is fairly predictable, but at the same time the film felt unfinished with the fates of several players in question.

What we expect from the trailer is an action-packed ride, and nothing else. Netflix has already done it last year with Red Notice, which broke records on OTT viewing. Now, with the same aim, the Russo Bros have tried their version of a spy-action-drama with a basic old plot and a lot of action. The duo deliver some high-octane action sequences to make fans happy, but the film doesn't know anything better about the storyline. The old cliches bore you despite a short runtime, with action sequences working as the saving grace.The film follows the hunt for the CIA's most skilled mercenary known as Court Gentry, aka Sierra Six (Ryan Gosling), who has accidentally uncovered dark secrets of the agency. He becomes a primary target and is hunted around the world by a psychopathic former colleague, Lloyd Hansen (Chris Evans), and international assassins. Another CIA agent, Dani Miranda (Ana de Armas), accompanies Six just to save her reputation, while Lloyd calls upon a sexy Tamil friend, Avik (Dhanush), a merciless killer. The cat and mouse game between Lloyd and Six forms the crux of the rest of the story. While following a cliched plot, The Gray Man tries no variety at all, which hurts. The screenplay seems pacy due to back-to-back chase sequences and action stunts, but lacks interesting conflicts.Performance-wise, Ryan Gosling as Sierra Six is decent. Frankly, this isn't an acting-driven film, but still, the actors try to add something extra of their own, which is noticeable. Six's character is quite prominent because of Ryan's physics and emotional quotient. Chris Evans' gruesomeness as Lloyd and his never-care-for-anyone attitude with humour packs a good punch. However, the basic points like reliability and temperament are missing from his character. The female forces, Ana De Armas, Julia Butters and Alfre Woodard, have done well with their limited screen space, but they do play important roles in the film. Indian actor Dhanush has like a 10-minute role, and it's all about merciless and bloodshed action. Yes, he has his heart in the right place, which will surely please his die-hard fans.The technical aspects of The Gray Man are below par. Except for brilliant cinematography, the other technical aspects fail to leave a mark. Stephen F. Windon's camerawork may not be that great, but look out for those action scenes. The way he pans and shifts the camera in the darkness is indeed praiseworthy. The editing by Jeff Groth and Pietro Scalia has had a few problems coming continuously right from the beginning. It's an action-packed film alright; that's some extra boost for sure, but the background score doesn't grow as it should have been. The action stunts are enjoyable, though.The Russo Brothers have adopted the novel with no extra features, which makes things very corny. Also, their intention to start a franchise based upon a novel seems interesting. The reputation of the Avengers films has put tremendous pressure on Anthony Russo and Joe Russo, and I guess that's why anything they make looks underwhelming. Of course, not every film they make can be that big and marvellous, so it's okay to look for a different view through different perspectives. The Gray Man takes you on an action-packed ride filled with out-and-out merciless fight scenes and bloodshed, despite the weak story at the centre. So overall, it's a watchable affair for your eyes if you don't mind not putting extra strain on your brain.RATING - 5/10*", "helpful": 212, "title": "The Russo Brothers' Adaptation Of Gray Man Novel Is All About Merciless Action And Weak Story.", "author": "ur50463365", "date": "22 July 2022", "rating": 5, "not_helpful": 158}, {"content": "To start with something positive: The movie looks good, the production quality is high, i like the drone shot although they are totally unnecessary.

Hey, I'm with you! Mine are also quite different. Also I don't remotely look like Ryan Gosling - especially not when you consider the one scene where he takes of his shirt (depending on what you like, you may find that arousing or abhorent I reckon, but I can't even imagine what he had to go through to get that ... physique - no pun intended) ... just saying.But it is not just the Ryan Gosling and Chris Evans show. There are some other players involved - like Billy Bob Thornton. Great as always - but also a kid, which was quite unexpected. For me at least. Also since I had no idea who was in the movie besides the two main actors, I also was pleasantly surprised by Ana De Armas and her appearance - fully clothed in case you are wondering.The Russo brothers call this their realistic take/movie. Considering they had a long Marvel (MCU) run, it is understandable that they might feel this way. All things considering though, this is quite often anything but realistic. I'm not complaining mind you - you can tell by my rating of course. But don't come into this with the expectation that it is real life. Or the stunts are actually plausible.

And it works - the Russos have worked out how and what audiences might want. Because they are \"audience\" as well (sorry for the pun or bad writing, but you get the point).I was lucky enough to watch it on a big screen, before it hits the smaller screens on Netflix. But I think since it is well mixed, it will work either way. Shame the Russos allegedly have said something negative about cinemas though.

Six (\"007 was taken\") is colder hearted and more deadly than Bond ever was. Lloyd is just heartless and uncool.Yet the deficiency is that Bond usually has verbal dexterity fully within hearing distance-Six (Gosling far from his memorable taciturn Drive persona), and his pursuer Lloyd (evens leagues away from his Captain America persona), are never speaking more than a sentence or two over loud explosions. You got it, this stylish Netflix thriller is all about Russo Brothers' action dexterity (They helmed such Marvel spectaculars as Avengers Endgame), which is fully in view and satisfying from a surface point of view.Case in point: one sequence in a Prague square has Six handcuffed to a stone bench fighting off world-class murderers, who use an amount of ammo that might give even the NRA pause. Cost $40 million-- 20% of the $200 million for the whole film.The Gray Man (Grays are elite assassins with almost license to kill) has Russo hyperactivity all over it-barely a minute or two before the next set piece that includes a hairy escape from a plummeting plane (a sequence fit for Tom Cruise). Breathless stuff that could have given more room to breaths that speak--most of the time it makes no sense, but, hey, what did you expect for 200 mil?The heart of this action film for me is Billy Bob Thornton's Fitzroy, an elderly CIA member caught by Lloyd in a blackmail over Fitzroy's teen age niece, Claire (Julia Butters), who has a heart condition. Not only is the connection warm, but also his paternal/mentor relationship with Six is almost normal were it not for the bad guys that interfere by doing such nasty things as shooting at Six and kidnapping Suzanne. Six's banter with Claire and his colleague Dani (Ana de Armas) show that he has a light side and some verbal capabilities, but no enough to take the film to a higher dramatic level.The Gray Man may be Netflix's best action flick so far, not a high bar, that can be seen as well in theaters, which I recommend for the full effect of Russo visual magic.

Sometimes its actually better to go old school get a new director lower budget make them have to be creative it seems you want to wreck a film throw millions at it you'll get scenes where a man is handcuffed to a bench with 100 TRAINED assassins and policemen shooting at him with ASSAULT rifles and rocket launchers and HE SURVIVES yeah ok..... then the scene after that words cant describe how stupid it is I'm not going to describe all the things that happened that were not only hard to believe but an actual insult that the director thought we would and buy it and by the scores I think he or she did fool most. I think that's why I've grown to love horror movies so much the storylines are more believable than 99 percent of these Hollywood films. People are comparing this to Bourne identity sorry but it's not even close and 1 COMPLETE BRAINDEAD MORON compared it to HEAT... this country has become SCARY!!! Jan 6th was a wake up call!! So is movies like this getting a 7!!", "helpful": 155, "title": "Come on people a 7?? Its no heat or John Wick it was completely IDIOTIC and UNBEARABLE!!
